The patterns of chemical and energy distributions revealed with imaging spectroscopy can be used to investigate the processes responsible for the function, composition and health of ecosystems, identify areas of stressed or diseased foliage for targeted treatment, estimate forage quality for herbivorous species, and identify some plant species through their unique chemical signatures. The following chapter outlines a method for estimating foliar nutrients and plant secondary metabolites at an individual tree-crown level with imaging spectroscopy data. These are the methods that will be used to create open-source foliar chemistry maps for selected Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) sites.</span></p><ul><li><span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;">Remote sensing biochemical properties of individual tree canopies can provide valuable information for forest and wildlife management and ecosystem studies.</span></li><li><span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;">We describe a procedure for modelling foliar chemistry from high spectral and high spatial resolution airborne remote sensing data.</span></li><li><span style="font-family:Calibri, serif;">The model development involves collecting training and testing datasets from identifiable tree crowns within the imagery, laboratory chemical analyses, pixel selection, and spectral pre-treatment routines.</span></li></ul><h2 id="HTable1.1Introduction" class="western" lang="en-US"><span><span id="_Toc352069266"></span>Table 1.1Introduction</span></h2><p class="western" style="text-align:JUSTIFY">Until recently, assessing plant chemistry on a landscape-scale has been impractical because it required sampling thousands of leaves in the field for lengthy laboratory analyses. Recent technological advances in infrared spectroscopy and hyperspectral remotes sensing are opening the door to the rapid assessment of leaf chemical composition in the lab and across whole forest canopies (for reviews see Majeke et al. 2008 and Kokaly et al. 2009). Imaging spectroscopy builds upon the extensive laboratory spectroscopy research that has identified strong relationships between the absorption of electromagnetic radiation and various chemical constituents (Curran 1989, Kokaly and Clark 1999, and Ebbers et al. 2002). Molecular vibrations resulting from the rotation, bending and stretching of chemical bonds absorb electromagnetic radiation at frequencies that correspond to their energy state and create harmonics and overtones in the near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Variations in reflectance at wavelengths that correspond to specific molecular interactions can be used to identify and quantify the chemical composition of materials based on high resolution spectral data (Table 10.1).</p><p class="western" style="text-align:JUSTIFY">Laboratory spectroscopy methods for estimating foliar chemicals based on visible and infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum typically use a combination of spectral feature enhancement and noise reduction techniques along with regression or principle component based modelling. These methods rely on training and testing datasets for model calibration and accuracy assessment. The techniques described in this chapter are based on those laboratory techniques, which are then applied to the airborne spectra collected with an imaging spectrometer, rather than spectra collected by a laboratory or field spectrometer. Several imagery processing steps are required to select relatively pure canopy leaf spectra from an airborne remote sensing image for training and testing data. Similarly, applying the resulting prediction algorithm to an entire image requires careful masking of non-canopy pixels and crown delineation to isolate individual tree crowns within the scene.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-after: avoid"><span id="_Toc352069274"></span> <strong><span style="font-size:0.8em;">Table ‎10..&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: normal">Recognised absorption features for various foliar chemical components</span></p><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><img src="./March Revied EstimatingFoliarChemistryOfIndividualTreeCrownsWithAirborneRemoteSensingData_v6.docx_files/March+Revied+EstimatingFoliarChemistryOfIndividualTreeCrownsWithAirborneRemoteSensingData_v6_html_226fcd45.png" alt="figure for TERN.tiff" border="0" height="496" name="Picture 0" style="text-align:BOTTOM" width="474"></p><p class="western" style="text-align:JUSTIFY"><span style="font-size:0.8em;">Adapted from “Using imaging spectroscopy to estimate integrated measures of foliage nutritional quality” by K.

These are the methods that will be used to create open-source foliar chemistry maps (chlorophyll a and b, total carotenoids, anthocyanin, carbon, nitrogen, available nitrogen, total polyphenols, and phosphorous) for selected TERN sites. An important caveat is that imaging spectroscopy is a relatively new and rapidly developing tool for measuring and monitoring landscape characteristics. The methods presented here for estimating and mapping variations in foliar chemicals across tree canopies with airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data are intended for research purposes. Further refinement and improvements of these methods are expected as the technology and our capabilities continue to develop and evolve.</p><h2 id="HTable1.2Leafsamplecollectionandanalysis" class="western" lang="en-US"><span><span id="_Toc352069267"></span>Table 1.2Leaf sample collection and analysis</span></h2><p class="western" style="text-align:JUSTIFY">Leaf sampling from selected trees in the imagery is conducted to provide model training and testing datasets of trees with known foliar chemical compositions. The foliar chemical concentration of each sampled tree is combined with the corresponding canopy spectral information from the remote sensing data to develop equations to predict foliar chemistry in unmeasured tree canopies based on spectral signatures from the remote sensing data. There are a number of considerations when selecting trees from which to develop your models. Selected trees should have more than fifty-percent canopy leaf cover and their canopies should be easily identifiable in the imagery. Sparsely leafed trees, understory trees, and trees with overlapping canopies with other trees should be avoided for training and testing datasets.</p><p class="western" style="text-align:JUSTIFY">If LiDAR data is available, and both the LiDAR and hyperspectral data are geo-corrected to at least one-meter accuracy, then trees can be selected that are clearly visible from above the forest canopy (not overlapping) or emergent from the canopy. If LiDAR data is unavailable, and the hyperspectral imagery is collected from a closed-canopy forest, then it is recommended that you collect some additional remote sensing flight-lines over nearby areas where the trees are isolated or semi-isolated, such as paddocks or partially cleared forest (Youngentob et al 2012). However, it is important that the samples trees are the same species as found in the contiguous forest in the imagery. It should be noted that due to differing environmental conditions, it is possible that trees sampled from open areas will have significantly different spectral and chemical profiles from trees of the same species that are found in forested areas. It is acceptable for the sampled trees to differ as a population from trees within the forest, on average, as long as they capture the range of spectral and chemical values of the forest trees. If the variability of spectral and chemical values in your forest is not captured by your sample, then the model will not be able to accurately predict foliar chemistry in canopies that fall outside the sampled spectral and chemical range. Increasing the sample size will help to improve the odds of incorporating the spectral and chemical variability that you are likely to encounter in tree canopies within the imagery.</p><p class="western" style="text-align:JUSTIFY">The total number of trees that need to be sampled is a matter of considerable uncertainty and may be influenced by the forest type and diversity of tree species. If you are able to collect fresh leaf spectra or canopy spectra with a field spectrometer in advance of the airborne remote sensing flight, the Mahalanobis distance calculations of spectral variation (Equation 1) can be used to estimate the spectral variability of the population.</p><p class="western" style="text-align:JUSTIFY">Let be the p x 1 vector corresponding to the k-th sample spectrum, where p is the number of wavebands, and the ‘t’ superscript denotes the vector transpose.

This information can also be used to determine whether the spectral variability of one population (i.e., a contiguous forest) can be captured by another (i.e., trees in a paddock).</p><p class="western" style="text-align:JUSTIFY">Previous experience from calculating spectral variability in euclaypt forests suggests that the total number of trees that need to be sampled for model training and testing is between 100-300 individuals, depending on the spectral and chemical variability of a forest. However, canopy chemistry of eucalypt woodlands dominated by one species has been modelled with a training and testing dataset of 60 trees (Huang et al 2004). Conversely, highly diverse tropical forest may require over a thousand samples to develop accurate prediction equations (Asner et al 2011). If you are unable to estimate spectral variability in advance, we recommend that you sample at least ten individuals of each canopy tree species, and if there are fewer than 10 canopy species, then a minimum of 100 individuals.</p><p class="western" style="text-align:JUSTIFY">Leaf-age can influence the concentrations of foliar chemicals in eucalypts (Kavanagh &amp; Lambert, 1990). Although Eucalyptus and many other Australian tree genera can produce new foliage throughout the year when conditions are favourable (Williams &amp; Woinarski, 1997), it is strongly recommended to time your data acquisition to correspond with peak leaf maturity at the end of the growing season. Tree chemistry can also change over time due to environmental factors. For this reason, leaf samples should be collected as close to the time of the over flight as possible, preferably within the same week. Models based on foliar chemistry assessed from samples collected more than a couple of weeks before or after the imagery acquisition, or mixed with samples collected over different time periods of longer than a few weeks, may not work.</p><p class="western" style="text-align:JUSTIFY">Collect the leaf samples from the top third of the canopy (i.e., visible to the sensor) and from an area in the canopy that is exposed to sunlight (i.e., top portion of branches). Leaf samples can be obtained with the aid of a sharp-shooter, arborist sling-shot, or cutting pole depending on the height of the tree. The arborist sling-shot method involves shooting a weighted bag with an attached thin nylon rope over a branch in the top third of the canopy. A flexible wire saw can then be pulled over the branch with the rope, or the branch can be pulled down with force using a sharp tug of the rope. Regardless of the method used, falling tree branches are dangerous and appropriate safety equipment, including a hard-hat and safety glasses must be worn at all times.</p><p class="western" style="text-align:JUSTIFY">As soon as the branch is obtained, collect approximately 50 grams of fully-expanded adult foliage. Carefully pick the leaves from the branch so that the leaves are not broken or crushed as they are removed. Place the sample(s) into a paper sandwich bag. Collect an additional six adult leaf samples and place in a small plastic sandwich bag. Label both bags with the tree ID number. We also recommend writing the tree ID number on water proof paper with a pencil or waterproof pen and placing this paper in the bags with the leaves in the event that the writing on the outside of the bags is somehow rendered illegible. Place both bags in a portable cooler with dry ice (solid carbon dioxide). Keep leaf samples frozen, preferably at least -80 degrees, until chemical analyses can be performed.</p><p class="western" style="text-align:JUSTIFY">Record the location of the tree with a differentially corrected GPS unit. Measure the diameter at breast height (DBH) and the height of the tree. Record the tree species and any notable features (e.g., florescence status, signs of herbivory). We also recommend marking the tree with an aluminium tree tag and an aluminium or galvanized nail to aid in relocating the tree.</p><p class="western" style="text-align:JUSTIFY">An important caveat is that leaf samples collected from a few branches may not represent the foliar chemistry of an entire tree canopy. It is also possible that the concentrations of foliar chemicals may change between the time of the over-flight and the time when the leaf samples are collected. These factors could contribute to model error. You can minimize these potential sources of error by collecting mature leaves from the top-third of the canopy (visible to the sensor) and through conscientious timing of leaf sample collection. The complicated logistics of remote sensing data acquisition in combination with concurrent field campaigns and the realistic limitations of canopy-leaf sampling, mean that these potential sources of error cannot be entirely eliminated.</p><p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0.42cm"><strong>Protocols for foliar chemical assays are publically available online through CSIRO Publishing’s Prometheus Wiki (protocols in ecological and environmental plant physiology: <span class="wikiexternallink"><a class="western" href="http://prometheuswiki.publish.csiro.au/tiki-custom_home.php">http://prometheuswiki.publish.csiro.au/tiki-custom_home.php</a></span>).</strong></p><h2 id="HTable1.3Hyperspectraldatapre-processingandcollectionoftreecanopyspectrafromtheimageryformodelcalibration" class="western" lang="en-US" style="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0.42cm"><span><span id="_Toc352069268"></span> Table 1.3Hyperspectral data pre-processing and collection of tree canopy spectra from the imagery for model calibration</span></h2><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm;text-align:JUSTIFY">The image analyses described below can be performed using ENVI (Research Systems, Inc., Boulder, Colorado); or other appropriate imagery software.

The selection of relatively pure canopy foliage pixels from the imagery is important for scaling reference values based on leaf chemistry to canopy-level spectra (Huang<em>&nbsp;</em>et al. 2007). To do this, first locate the tree crowns in the image from which the canopy-leaf samples have been collected. This may require revisiting the fieldsite with print-outs of the imagery. Once the tree crowns are positively identified, display the reflectance data in three wavebands from the SWIR (1.65 <em>µ</em>m), NIR (0.84 <em>µ</em>m) and VIS red-edge (0.67 <em>µ</em>m) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum (red, green and blue, respectively). Viewed in this combination, green pixels indicate high concentrations of chlorophyll containing vegetation (e.g., canopy leaves) and purple, blue, yellow and white pixels are either not as photosynthetically active (e.g., bark and branches) or highly shaded (Figure 10.2). Following the methods of Huang et al. (2004) select only those tree canopies from which at least 4 “good” (green) pixels can be collected from each tree for model training and testing data-sets. Make sure to remove duplicate pixels that can result from the nearest-neighbor resampling of image pixels during some geocorrecting procedures. Obtain a mean, median and maximum spectral value for each tree canopy based on the pixels collected from that canopy.</p><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 150%; page-break-after: avoid"><img src="./March Revied EstimatingFoliarChemistryOfIndividualTreeCrownsWithAirborneRemoteSensingData_v6.docx_files/March+Revied+EstimatingFoliarChemistryOfIndividualTreeCrownsWithAirborneRemoteSensingData_v6_html_6bdcb682.jpg" alt="spectra for chapter.jpg" border="0" height="184" name="Picture 13" style="text-align:BOTTOM" width="397"></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><span id="_Toc352069272"></span> <strong><span style="font-size:0.8em;">Figure ‎10..&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: normal">A continuum-removed reflectance spectra from a selected tree canopy pixel.

Several methods, including scatter-corrections, smoothing transformations, and derivative analysis have been developed to enhance signal components and reduce background effects in spectral data (Dhanoa et al., 1994; Tsai &amp; Philpot, 1998; Figure 10.3).

Then apply a standard normal variate (SNV) scatter correction to remove unnecessary signal components (Barnes et al. 1989). We recommend testing various combinations of Savitzy-Golay derivative-based spectral smoothing functions provided by the WinISI software (Win ISI; Port Matilda, PA), which also has been demonstrated to improve model fit by emphasizing absorption features whilst reducing noise (Tsai and Philpot 1998). Variability in optimal derivative and smoothing treatments among models is common in studies that used similar spectrometry methods with laboratory or imaging spectra (e.g., Youngentob et al. 2012, Huang et al., 2004, Ebbers et al. 2002). This is because the reflectance characteristics that correspond to particular foliar constituents have unique signatures that will interact differently with the various derivative and smoothing treatments according to their band-depth, location and width.</span></p><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%; page-break-after: avoid;text-align:JUSTIFY"><img src="./March Revied EstimatingFoliarChemistryOfIndividualTreeCrownsWithAirborneRemoteSensingData_v6.docx_files/March+Revied+EstimatingFoliarChemistryOfIndividualTreeCrownsWithAirborneRemoteSensingData_v6_html_4d6aaf88.gif" border="0" height="574" name="Picture 73" style="text-align:BOTTOM" width="318" alt="http://data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/temp/Good+Practice+Handbook/FoliarChemTreeCrowns/officeviewer/March+Revied+EstimatingFoliarChemistryOfIndividualTreeCrownsWithAirborneRemoteSensingData_v6.docx/March+Revied+EstimatingFoliarChemistryOfIndividualTreeCrownsWithAirborneRemoteSensingData_v6_html_4d6aaf88.gif"></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%;text-align:JUSTIFY"><span id="_Toc352069273"></span> <strong><span style="font-size:0.8em;">Figure ‎10..&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: normal">Spectral transformations applied to the maximum continuum-removed (CR) HyMap reflectance data from 77 eucalypt tree canopies: (a) pseudo-absorption spectra from the log(1/CR) data; (b) detrended log(1/CR) spectra; (c) standard normal variate (SNV) scatter correction applied to the detrended, log(1/CR) spectra; (d) a Savitzy-Golay derivative based spectral smoothing routine (e.g., 2221) applied to the SNV, detrended log(1/CR) spectra: 2221 = the second derivative (2) was calculated with a primary smoothing of 2 nm (2) across a gap size of 2nm (2) and no secondary smoothing (1).

Three methods are recommended and explained here; partial least squares regression (PLSR) based on all wavebands (Wold 1975), step-up and step-wise regression (Weisberg 1980). PLSR is a multivariate extension of multiple linear regression that determines the independent linear combinations of the predictor variables (i.e. wavebands) that explain the maximum covariation with the response variables (i.e. chemical concentrations). Thus, PLSR compresses the independent variables into factors, similar to a principal component regression. We recommend the modified PLSR described by Shenk and Westerhaus (MPLS, 1991a), which essentially normalizes (i.e., zero mean, unit variance) the chemical concentrations and reflectance values at each wavelength. PLSR requires cross-validation to prevent over-fitting the model (described below). Step-up and stepwise regression can also be used to develop models based on a subset of wavebands. Step-up regression begins with a single waveband from the full spectrum and then adds subsequent wavebands to the regression model (Weisberg 1980). The waveband selected is the one that results in the largest increase in model-fit, which is assessed with the coefficient of determination, R<sup>2</sup>. The model is run with the added variable and this process can be repeated to add additional terms. Stepwise regression is a variation of step-up regression that relies on an F test of significance to determine whether a previous term can be removed once a new term is added to the model.</p><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm;text-align:JUSTIFY">Over-fitting is a common problem in linear regression models, resulting from a tendency of fitting procedures to want to exploit as large a number of predictor variables as possible to explain all the variation in a given training dataset. While the fit to training data is very good, it is likely to result in a regression model that is too complex to have any real predictive power for independent validation data (Weisberg 1980). The number of terms selected for a model requires consideration of the sample size, the closeness of fit and the contribution of each additional term. To avoid over-fitting a model, use a test-of-exact-fit to identify the maximum number of terms that could be expected to fit the population covariance matrix—based on the number of samples and wavebands (Bollen and Long 1993).</p><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm;text-align:JUSTIFY">Model-fit can be further assessed using cross-validation (Elisseeff and Pontil 2002). Cross-validation provides an estimate of model error based on data resampling. For example, in 6-fold cross-validation, samples are split into 6 groups and trained six times on all but one group, which serves as validation data. A standard error of cross-validation (SECV) is obtained by pooling the residuals from each prediction and averaging the estimates of prediction error across the six repetitions. Obtaining an external estimate of prediction is not always feasible for small datasets. In these instances, cross-validation is appropriate because it enables a model to be trained and tested using all available data (Elisseeff and Pontil 2002). Two additional benefits of cross-validation are that it can be used to help identify the optimum number of terms for a model and outliers are easily identified from the prediction residuals (Shenk and Westerhaus 1991b, Baumann 2003). Although cross-validation is commonly used in spectrometry, some caution must be taken when interpreting model accuracy because the ability of the model to fit new data depends on how well the training-data represents the entire population. An additional indication of model stability can be obtained by comparing the training and testing standard errors from the cross-validation, which should be similar. Another caveat is that MPLS, step-up and stepwise regression assumes a linear relationship between leaf reflectance and concentrations of foliar biochemicals and ignores possible non-linear interactions that can result from multiple scattering effects (Borel and Gerstl 1994).</p><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm;text-align:JUSTIFY">Select the best performing model for each foliar chemical constituent. If possible, test model accuracy using an independent testing dataset of trees in the imagery with known chemical values. If an independent dataset is not available due to sampling limitations, then use the cross-validation method described above to assess model performance. The best performing algorithms to predict each foliar chemical can then be applied to the entire image using the automated pixel selection method described by Huang et al. (2007) and crown delineation (Culvenor, 2003). Ensure that the same spectral transformations applied to the spectra used to develop the prediction algorithm are also applied to all modelled spectra in the imagery. It is also important to note that crown delineation can be highly challenging. The performance of various delineation algorithms are influenced by the spatial resolution of the remote sensing data and the architecture of the trees in the imagery. For high-spatial resolution data, the Tree Identification and Delineation Algorithm (TIDA) described by Culvenor (2002), can provide a reasonable estimation of tree crowns and canopy branch clusters.</p><h2 id="HReferences" class="western" lang="en-US"><span><span id="_Toc352069270"></span>References</span></h2><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.35cm"><span lang="en-US">Asner, G.P., Martin, R.E., Knapp, D.E., Tupayachi, R., Anderson, C., Carranza, L., Martinez, P., Houcheime, M., Sinca, F., Weiss, P.
