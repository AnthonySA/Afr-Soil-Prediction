The data have been **_monotonously transformed_** from the original measurements and thus include negative values. <br>\r\n* **PIDN:** unique soil sample identifier\r\n* **SOC:** Soil organic carbon\r\n* **pH:** pH values\r\n* **Ca:** Mehlich-3 extractable Calcium\r\n* **P:** Mehlich-3 extractable Phosphorus\r\n* **Sand:** Sand content \r\n* **m7497.96 - m599.76:** There are 3,578 mid-infrared absorbance measurements. For example, the \"m7497.96\" column is the absorbance at wavenumber 7497.96 cm-1. We suggest you to remove spectra CO2 bands which are in the region m2379.76 to m2352.76, but you do not have to.\r\n* **Depth:** Depth of the soil sample (2 categories: \"Topsoil\", \"Subsoil\")<br>\r\n\r\nThere are also some potential spatial predictors from remote sensing data sources. Short variable descriptions are provided below and additional descriptions can be found at AfSIS data. The data have been mean **_centered_** and **_scaled_**.<br>\r\n\r\n* **BSA:** average long-term Black Sky Albedo measurements from MODIS satellite images (BSAN = near-infrared, BSAS = shortwave, BSAV = visible)\r\n* **CTI:** compound topographic index calculated from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission elevation data\r\n* **ELEV:** Shuttle Radar Topography Mission elevation data\r\n* **EVI:** average long-term Enhanced Vegetation Index from MODIS satellite images.\r\n* **LST:** average long-term Land Surface Temperatures from MODIS satellite images (LSTD = day time temperature, LSTN = night time temperature)\r\n* **Ref:** average long-term Reflectance measurements from MODIS satellite images (Ref1 = blue, Ref2 = red, Ref3 = near-infrared, Ref7 = mid-infrared)\r\n* **Reli:** topographic Relief calculated from Shuttle Radar Topography mission elevation data\r\n* **TMAP & TMFI:** average long-term Tropical Rainfall Monitoring Mission data (TMAP = mean annual precipitation, TMFI = modified Fournier index)<br>\r\n\r\n### Data Exploration\r\n![Data exploration](https://github.com/ivanliu1989/Afr-Soil-Prediction/tree/master/image/outlers.png)<br>\r\n\r\n### Preprocess and Data Transformation\r\n![Derivatives/Smoothe comparison](https://github.com/ivanliu1989/Afr-Soil-Prediction/tree/master/image/dev_smoo_comp_2.png)<br>\r\n![Savitzky-Golay filtering](https://github.com/ivanliu1989/Afr-Soil-Prediction/tree/master/image/Savitzky-Golay.png)<br>\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIvan Liu (@ivanliu1989)\r\n\r\n### References\r\n[An introduction to the prospectr package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/prospectr/vignettes/prospectr-intro.pdf)<br>\r\n[Visible and near infrared spectroscopy in soil science](http://pub.epsilon.slu.se/5165/1/stenberg_b_etal_100907.pdf)<br>\r\n[Improving Phosphours Sensing by Eliminating Soil Particle Size Effect in Spectral Measurement](http://www.abe.ufl.edu/wlee/Publications/TransASAE-Vol48-No5-p1971-1978-ParticleSizeEffect.pdf)<br>\r\n[Ensemble Selection from Libraries of Models](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~caruana/ctp/ct.papers/caruana.icml04.icdm06long.pdf)<br>","google":"UA-49140027-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
